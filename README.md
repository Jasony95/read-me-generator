# README.md File Generator

## Description

The motivation was to create a README template file quickly instead of having to create a new one.

I build this project, because there are some users that want to save time by getting the formats and templates ready instead of having to type everything in the file.

The problems involve inexperienced users to quickly create a README.md file instead of using their time to create a new one.

I learned that Markdown isn't a bad language as it is.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
