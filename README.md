# README Generator

## Description

The motivation was to create a README template file quickly instead of having to create a new one.

I build this project, because there are some users that want to save time by getting the formats and templates ready instead of having to type everything in the file.

The problems involve inexperienced users to quickly create a README.md file instead of using their time to create a new one.

I learned that Markdown isn't a bad language as it is.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

1. Download the repo zipped folder.
2. Unzip the zipped folder.
3. Run the index.js file in a terminal that have node.js installed.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

## Features

Coding involves deleting the README file if it is there and then creating the new file again so the data doesn't append in the old README file.
